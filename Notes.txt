Commit messages should have a nice message and
tell the story. We use whole sentences. But
the story is not so "nice" becaus we need to
mix technical and domain changes during work.
This is a feature of TDD.

We can tag commit messages like twitter by
using hashtags in the sentences.

* progress is very slow
* good discussions
* TDDaiymi is forcing us to simplicity
* but TDDaiymi maybe gives us unexpected outcome
* collaboration is great
* no problems in getting into pairing
* network lag keeps Peter in check
* looks like we are getting somewhere

Vision is that we have a copy with two cells
and so forth and in the end wi combine all
the methods to a complete solution.
